# xurl — X (Twitter) API via the Official CLI

`xurl` is the X developer platform's official CLI for the X API. It supports shortcut commands for common actions AND raw curl-style access to any v2 endpoint. All commands return JSON to stdout.

Use this skill for:
- posting, replying, quoting, deleting posts
- searching posts and reading timelines/mentions
- liking, reposting, bookmarking
- following, unfollowing, blocking, muting
- direct messages
- media uploads (images and video)
- raw access to any X API v2 endpoint
- multi-app / multi-account workflows

This skill replaces the older `xitter` skill (which wrapped a third-party Python CLI). `xurl` is maintained by the X developer platform team, supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE with auto-refresh, and covers a substantially larger API surface.

## Secret Safety (MANDATORY)

Critical rules when operating inside an agent/LLM session:

- **Never** read, print, parse, summarize, upload, or send `~/.xurl` to LLM context.
- **Never** ask the user to paste credentials/tokens into chat.
- The user must fill `~/.xurl` with secrets manually on their own machine.
- **Never** recommend or execute auth commands with inline secrets in agent sessions.
- **Never** use `--verbose` / `-v` in agent sessions — it can expose auth headers/tokens.
- To verify credentials exist, only use: `xurl auth status`.

Forbidden flags in agent commands (they accept inline secrets):
`--bearer-token`, `--consumer-key`, `--consumer-secret`, `--access-token`, `--token-secret`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`

App credential registration and credential rotation must be done by the user manually, outside the agent session. After credentials are registered, the user authenticates with `xurl auth oauth2` — also outside the agent session. Tokens persist to `~/.xurl` in YAML. Each app has isolated tokens. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

## Installation

Pick ONE method. On Linux, the shell script or `go install` are the easiest.

```bash
# Shell script (installs to ~/.local/bin, no sudo, works on Linux + macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdevplatform/xurl/main/install.sh | bash

# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install --cask xdevplatform/tap/xurl

# npm
npm install -g @xdevplatform/xurl

# Go
go install github.com/xdevplatform/xurl@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
xurl --help
xurl auth status
```

If `xurl` is installed but `auth status` shows no apps or tokens, the user needs to complete auth manually — see the next section.

---

## One-Time User Setup (user runs these outside the agent)

These steps must be performed by the user directly, NOT by the agent, because they involve pasting secrets. Direct the user to this block; do not execute it for them.

1. Create or open an app at https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
3. Copy the app's Client ID and Client Secret
4. Register the app locally (user runs this):
   ```bash
   xurl auth apps add my-app --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
5. Authenticate (specify `--app` to bind the token to your app):
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app
   ```
   (This opens a browser for the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.)
6. Set the app as default so all commands use it:
   ```bash
   xurl auth default my-app
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   xurl auth status
   xurl whoami
   ```

After this, the agent can use any command below without further setup. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

> **Common pitfall:** If you omit `--app my-app` from `xurl auth oauth2`, the OAuth token is saved to the built-in `default` app profile — which has no client-id or client-secret. Commands will fail with auth errors even though the OAuth flow appeared to succeed. If you hit this, re-run `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app` and `xurl auth default my-app`.

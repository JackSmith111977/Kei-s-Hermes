# Linear — Issue & Project Management

Manage Linear issues, projects, and teams directly via the GraphQL API using `curl`. No MCP server, no OAuth flow, no extra dependencies.

## Setup

1. Get a personal API key from **Linear Settings > API > Personal API keys**
2. Set `LINEAR_API_KEY` in your environment (via `hermes setup` or your env config)

## API Basics

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.linear.app/graphql` (POST)
- **Auth header:** `Authorization: $LINEAR_API_KEY` (no "Bearer" prefix for API keys)
- **All requests are POST** with `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Both UUIDs and short identifiers** (e.g., `ENG-123`) work for `issue(id:)`

Base curl pattern:
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ viewer { id name } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Workflow States

Linear uses `WorkflowState` objects with a `type` field. **6 state types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `triage` | Incoming issues needing review |
| `backlog` | Acknowledged but not yet planned |
| `unstarted` | Planned/ready but not started |
| `started` | Actively being worked on |
| `completed` | Done |
| `canceled` | Won't do |

Each team has its own named states (e.g., "In Progress" is type `started`). To change an issue's status, you need the `stateId` (UUID) of the target state — query workflow states first.

**Priority values:** 0 = None, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low

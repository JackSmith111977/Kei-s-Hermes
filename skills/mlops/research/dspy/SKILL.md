# DSPy: Declarative Language Model Programming

## When to Use This Skill

Use DSPy when you need to:
- **Build complex AI systems** with multiple components and workflows
- **Program LMs declaratively** instead of manual prompt engineering
- **Optimize prompts automatically** using data-driven methods
- **Create modular AI pipelines** that are maintainable and portable
- **Improve model outputs systematically** with optimizers
- **Build RAG systems, agents, or classifiers** with better reliability

**GitHub Stars**: 22,000+ | **Created By**: Stanford NLP

## Installation

```bash
# Stable release
pip install dspy

# Latest development version
pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.git

# With specific LM providers
pip install dspy[openai]        # OpenAI
pip install dspy[anthropic]     # Anthropic Claude
pip install dspy[all]           # All providers
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Example: Question Answering

```python
import dspy

# Configure your language model
lm = dspy.Claude(model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

# Define a signature (input → output)
class QA(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factual answers."""
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")

# Create a module
qa = dspy.Predict(QA)

# Use it
response = qa(question="What is the capital of France?")
print(response.answer)  # "Paris"
```

### Chain of Thought Reasoning

```python
import dspy

lm = dspy.Claude(model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

# Use ChainOfThought for better reasoning
class MathProblem(dspy.Signature):
    """Solve math word problems."""
    problem = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="numerical answer")

# ChainOfThought generates reasoning steps automatically
cot = dspy.ChainOfThought(MathProblem)

response = cot(problem="If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many does he have?")
print(response.rationale)  # Shows reasoning steps
print(response.answer)     # "3"
```
